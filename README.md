# Code_Snippets
This repository is just a collection of miscellaneous code and shell scripts that aren't part of my i3 setup configuration.

I've set up this repo using the GPL 3 licence just in case anyone finds any of this useful and wants to download it, but it's mostly personal bits that may not fit well on any other person's setup, but feel free to take what you need.
