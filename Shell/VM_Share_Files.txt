Brief explanation of how to setup file sharing between host and guest in virt-manager

Set up vm hardware -9p.

Add code in terminal in guest. I use the Public folder as the shared folder, but you could make another folder called something like 'Shared' or whatever.

	sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio /sharepoint Public 

You will want to alias the above code to save typing, so add alias to .bashrc as below (or similar)
	
	alias vmshare="Code as above"
